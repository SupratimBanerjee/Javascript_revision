Variables = these are the storing boxes which can store nos,integers,strings,bolean values,decimal nos.

string = they are text form and it is necessary to write them in double cottation.

conditional programming = these are the statements which are used to define a condition.if- else is a conditional statements.Example- if trex touches obstacle.

lopping statements = these are the statements which are used to iterate a string or nos,etc by our need.Ex-for loop,while.

gameState =  it usually defines the state of the game.Ex-serve,play,end;

function = there are 2 types of function - 1.system defined function,example-function setup,function preload,function draw.
                                           2.user  defined function,example-function spawnClouds,spawnObstacle.
functon are used to delicate complex tasks to  seperate function so that the code is redeable.And the same function can becalled many times.

1. infinite scrolling ground.
2.arrays - syntax of array.ex-  var a = [1,2,3,4,infinity]
we use arrays when we have to store similar datain one memory location - ex storring of roll nos in a class.

4. switch statements.

5. grouping of sprites.

6. logical writing of our own function - ex - touching.

1.Matter.js or the physics engine.
2.Class is creating blueprints.ex - class Box,  class Bird
3.creating objects-ex- box1=new Box.
4.JSON format.
5.calling API.
6.constrained bodies.
7. code debugging.
8.push and pop
